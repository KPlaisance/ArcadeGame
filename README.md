#ArcadeGame - Keith Plaisance's Frogger Arcade Game
This game is the third project in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program.

It is a game where the goal is to make the boy cross the road while dodging enemies. If he makes it the other side, next to the river
than he wins the game and can replay the game. If the player gets hit by an enemy he returns to the starting position. A modal shows up when the player wins the game.

I used a walkthrough by Matthew Cranford and Udacity as reference with help figuring out how to setup the game.
